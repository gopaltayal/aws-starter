# Master Changelog File
#
# For each new migration (creation / deletion / update of a table),
# create a separate file in the "db/migrations" directory.
#
# Please respect the following naming scheme:
# "YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-short-description-of-migration.yml"
#
# The migrations are only run, if they are explicitly included at the end of this file.
# You can find an example of the file structure below:
#
# databaseChangeLog:
#   - include:
#       file: db/migrations/2020-12-07-1020-create-some-table.yml
#   - include:
#       file: db/migrations/2020-12-07-1645-create-another-table.yml
#
# Note: We don't use "includeAll" here in order to avoid migrations to be run accidentally.
