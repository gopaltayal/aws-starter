# ADR-001 : Usage of Kotlin in as the primary language of choice
Created : 22-Mar-2023
## Status
ACCEPTED
## Context
Which programming language should be used for development of the aws-starter project?
## Decision
We decided to use Kotlin for its brevity and experimentation to understand whether the code can actually support a production grade application. 
Java code is verbose whereas Kotlin is concise and removes the need for writing down boilerplate code. 
This makes it naturally easy to read, less prone to errors and allows you to write significantly fewer lines of code to achieve a task.
## Consequences
Brevity also comes at a cost. Too much of it can also lead to unmanageable code. 
What is important here is to focus on the potential that Kotlin can offer.
